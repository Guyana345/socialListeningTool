The kind of data that official channels like API data streams provide is very limited. Despite harboring warehouses of data on consumers’ behavior, social media companies only provide a sliver of it through their APIs (for Facebook, developers can only get data for public pages and groups, and for Twitter, this access is often restricted to a set number of tweets from a user’s timeline or to a set time frame for search).

Scripts and instructions related to APIs can be found in the [`01-apis`](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/tree/master/01-apis) directory of this repository.

##### Personal Archives
There are ways for users of social media platforms to request and download archives of their own online persona and behavior. Some services like Facebook or Twitter will allow users to download a history of the data that constitutes their posts, their messaging, or their profile photos.

Scripts and instructions related to personal archives can be found in the [`02-personal-archives`](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/tree/master/02-personal-archives/) directory of this repository.

##### Scraping
While there's plenty of social media data on display on the sites you browse, extracting social media data from the platforms through scraping is often against the terms of service. Scraping a social media platform can get users booted from a service and potentially even result in a lawsuit.

If you end up wanting to look into harvesting data from the social web, there is information information related in the  [`03-scraping`](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/tree/master/03-scraping/) directory of this repository.

### Setup

Below is a set of instructions you can follow to get your machine ready to run any of the Python scripts in this repository. While Python is one of the most powerful languages for data gathering and analysis, it can take a few tries to get it installed and running properly. If you're a beginner, don't despair though, these growing pains are normal and can vary from machine to machine. We promise the payoff is worth it!


### Getting your data

Hooray! You're ready to get your data now. We have created a directory for scripts that you can use to get data from each data source.

You can follow the directions for each script in its sub-folders:
* To gather data from APIs, you can use the scripts in this directory: [`01-apis`](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/tree/master/01-apis)
* To gather data from personal archives, you can use the scripts in this directory: [`02-personal-archives`](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/tree/master/02-personal-archives/)
* To gather data from live web sites, you can use the scripts and instructions in this directory: [`03-scraping`](https://github.com/lamthuyvo/social-media-data-scripts/tree/master/03-scraping/)
